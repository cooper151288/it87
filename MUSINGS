Here, I will discuss reults from my poking around with the IT8728F, so I know what I've done and to share the results so more features can be exposed.

CLOSED LOOP CONTROL
-yes it works.
-yes the documentation is poor, but you should read it anyway

-Set the relevant register.from 0x15-0x17 to 0x84-0x86, depending on which temp input you want.
-You will want to increase the smoothing step frequency from the 1Hz default.
-You may want to enable smoothing. It's not in the datasheet for this mode but it sto`s it ramping up and down like crazy.
 It will affect your other fans so be careful.
 -You will want to reduce the target zone value from default as well.
 
 -Setting too low a value for the target RPM will make the fans speed up and slow down, giving unstable RPM values. 
 IT8728 must Be a bit too slow to give good closed loop control on heavy fans w/voltage control.
 My board only gas actual PWM on the CPU fan header (pwms 1,3- voltage/pwm on CPU, pwm2 is voltage on sys_fan header) 

 Set like this, you get fairly smooth.closed loop control.
 I'll write a handy bash script to set this up soon, then it can be added to the driver.
 
 If anyone wishes to add to the driver, share test results, write a script, fee free to make a pull request.
