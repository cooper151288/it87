Here, I will discuss reults from my poking around with the IT8728F, so I know what I've done and to share the results so more features can be exposed.

CLOSED LOOP CONTROL
-yes it works.
-yes the documentation is poor, but you should read it anyway

-Set the relevant register.from 0x15-0x17 to 0x84-0x86, depending on which temp input you want.
-You will want to increase the smoothing step frequency from the 1Hz default.
-You may want to enable smoothing. It's not in the datasheet for this mode but it stops it ramping up and down like crazy.
 It will affect your other fans so be careful.
 -You will want to reduce the target zone value from default as well.
 
 Set like this, you get fairly smooth.closed loop control.
 I'll write a handy bash script to set this up soon, then it can be added to the driver.
 
 If anyone wishes to add to the driver, share test results, write a script, fee free to make a pull request.
